While using Expo CLI, I encountered an unusual error where the development server would intermittently crash without any clear error messages in the console. This would happen randomly during development, requiring a restart of the Expo Go app and the development server.  The project itself would compile and run normally, but this crashing behaviour made development frustrating. No specific code changes seemed to trigger it.
